# vue-shopping-list

![npm][npm-version-image]

This repository was created to demonstrate a mobile shopping list application made in Vue, Vuex, Vue Router and some custom Animate.css stuff :) ... The plan is to use Node/Express and Web Sockets using "ws" or "socket.io" to get some real time feedback when adding or crossing off items in a grocery list. Currently the application is hitting Apiary until I get Node up and running with Mongo.

## Requirements
The following tools are required to get this running.

### Dev tools
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>=7.7.0 <=8.1.x` *~NPM will install automatically*
* NPM `~5.3.x`
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community) - shell version `3.4.3`

## Installation
### Install Node
Visit [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) - download and install the latest, stable version.
This will install `npm` automatically.

### Install dependencies
`cd` into the root of the project and run this command
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Install MongoDB

### Run project
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
